# Prashiskshan Backend

This repository contains an Express.js backend scaffold for the Prashiskshan internship management platform. The current version includes placeholder modules so we can progressively flesh out each feature area.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The above commands install dependencies and start the development server with hot reload.

## Project Layout

The `src` directory mirrors the target architecture documented in the specification. Each file currently exports a minimal placeholder implementation that will be expanded in subsequent phases.
